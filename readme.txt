Booking.com Affiliates, this plugin allows you to add a typical booking.com booking module on any wordpress site.

== Description ==

Booking.com Affiliates, this plugin allows you to add a typical booking.com booking module on any wordpress site. Simply configure what you want the searchbox to look like and generate traffic to your booking.com  affiliate pages.

= Create your search box =

All you need is a Booking.com affiliate ID and a wordpress site. Configure your ideal search box and the plugin will take care of the rest. The code is 100% compliant with the official settings & parameters as per the booking.com documentation and example. No need to learn and digest, it's all done for you and only a couple of clicks away.

= Display your box where you need it =

With the new plugin architecture, you can now leverage the flexibility of the shortcodes to display your search box in your posts, in your pages or on your widgetized areas (sidebar, footer). 

= Manage your search boxes centrally =

Shortcode are not all about it, to keep your site manageable and scalable, all your search boxes can be found in one location and can be updated centrally. If your site evolves or if you just want to get things updated, just go to your plugin page, no need to put your hands again into all of the many placements where you could have your boxes locates. Each box is independant from the other, so you can change all your settings, even your Affiliate ID, per box and placement.

* Fixed a big nasty compatibility issue with some installation. Anyone using WAMP will appreciate.

= 1.0.1 =
Minor update, recommended for all users.
* I added back the widget, by "popular" demand (well, frequent, at least :)).
* Added a "no categorization" option in the edit panel.

= 1.0 =
I now dare call this plugin STABLE. This doesn't mean there are no more bugs or that it is final, it does mean that I think it won't break sites anymore.
* Shortcodes : by public demand, the plugin now handles shortcodes, including a fancy menu in the post editor (TinyMCE) to easily add the correct search box.
* Multiple instances : the plugin now is architectured to handle multiple & independant searchboxes. You can have one by page, post, footer, sidebar... Warning : for this release, there are still known bugs when using multiple boxes with the calendar option on the same page. Don't blame ME, booking.com designed it that way...
* Cleaner html output : Editable width that really works. Reworked div structure that shouldn't break any templates anymore.
* Added Portuguese : thanks to Paulo for submitting (paulosantos.org)

= 0.2.6 =
* While preparing the UI for the next major release, I found out the code provided by booking.com is actually missing 1 div closing bracket ! I added it back in. This should hopefully address a number of template issues reported by users. Please note on narrow sites displayed on wide monitors, the calendars might show a bit higher on the page than they should. This is the "correct" behaviour of the script provided by Booking.com.

= 0.2.5 =
* Added Turkish, per (anonymous) user request via the [suggestion form](http://www.booking-plugin.com/suggest-new-features).
* Please note the next few updates coming up are relatively large. The first big update should come early june 2013. Make sure you do not do the update on the road or without a few spare mins in front of you... Just so you can get used to the new shiny stuff and reconfigure it all as needed.

= 0.2.3 =
* Another bug fix with the CSS inclusion.

= 0.2.2 =
* New feature : allow you to display the results in a new browser window OR in the same window.
* New language : Italian

= 0.2.1 =
* Added missing CSS file.

= 0.2 =
* Rebuilt from the ground up from the original booking.com code. No more iframe = better browser handling, better user interface integration and better analytics tracking... but above anything else : Calendars will now show up correctly !
* No more "height" required
* English, French, German, Dutch and Spanish supported (more languages to come soon)
* Compliance fixes

= 0.1.3 =
* Cleaner code

= 0.1.2 =
* Bug Fix: The widget class was conflicting with some other widgets. Fixed.
* Bug Fix: The plugin could not be activated when using BuddyPress. Fixed.


= 0.1.1 =
* Bug Fix: Forgot to update the Widget name... Ooops !
* Bug Fix: The link from the widget was pointing to the wrong admin page. Fixed.

	=> Thanks to MD @ menorcadiferente.com for pointing these out !
